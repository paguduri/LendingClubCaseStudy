## General Information

### Project Information

> The project is a data science project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background

> Lending Club company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. Identification of such applicant's using EDA is the aim of this case study.

### Project Statement

> Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

### Data Set

> The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.


## Conclusions

- Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
  1. DTI
  2. Grades
  3. Verification Status
  4. Annual income
  5. Pub_rec_bankruptcies
- Other considerations for 'defaults' :
  1. Burrowers from large urban cities like california, new york, texas, florida etc.
  2. Burrowers having annual income in the range 50000-100000.
  3. Burrowers having Public Recorded Bankruptcy.
  4. Burrowers with least grades like E,F,G which indicates high risk.
  5. Burrowers with very high Debt to Income value.
  6. Burrowers with working experience 1 year and 10+ years.
